# Deep-Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled
Main Steps to build a model

* Import libraries
* Data gathering
* Data cleaning
* Data preprocessing
* Define veriables
* Data splitting:to training, validation, and testing sets.
* Define model
        - Model Architecture: Input layer, hidden layer, output layer
		- Model parameters: loss function, activation function, learning rate, epoch..
* Tune the model
* Fit the model
* Model prediction
* Model accuracy
